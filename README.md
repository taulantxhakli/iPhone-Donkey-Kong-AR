# iPhone-Donkey-Kong-AR
A fun little AR app written in second semester of Junior year at STAC.
The Donkey Kong 64 model was taken from this website: <https://www.models-resource.com/nintendo_64/donkeykong64/>
Note: The project was made for iPhone 11 originally, but it should work with any iPhone capable of running the app.
